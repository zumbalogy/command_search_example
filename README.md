This is a demo of Command Search: https://github.com/zumbalogy/command_search
of which the relevant code is here: https://github.com/zumbalogy/command_search_example/blob/master/app/models/earthquake.rb

map from: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BlankMap-Equirectangular.svg

TODO:

have them be properly sorted by date.

"hawaii" zooms the map funny

add time of day field.

make "cleaned" in the disclaimer a link to the code

clicking the map could search results within a few degrees of where you clicked

a timeline above the map could be nice.

selected one could be a diff color on map/timeline

make question mark pop up helper box in the input to show off syntax and all.

build selected-result card pretty and make things clickable so that clicking country:spain puts "country:spain" in the search box

make the map take up more room

make the map zoom a little bit when it can

proper paging

give lat and long to the 49 with 0 and 0 as their lat and long
:008 > Earthquake.search("latitude:0 longitude>0").count
 => 5


country:"" causes (Request URL: http://localhost:5000/search/Y291bnRyeToiIg==) command search to error

 how to run locally (have mongo, bundle, seed, foreman start, go to port)
