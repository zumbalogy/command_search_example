### TODO:

have them be properly sorted by date.

----------------------//////////////////////////////

add time of day field.

----------------------//////////////////////////////

consider, in the seeds.rb, using nils when the value is nil as opposed to converting it to zero.
maybe with -1 or something. nil is more realistic for the demo though.

----------------------//////////////////////////////

on xps 13 screen, dates get wrapped on UI.
also, look into font of "source code"
also, look into bottom margin of quake list
